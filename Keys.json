Since Shapeshifter was hacked, his key collection (including key 0000) was lost. Other collectors have tracked down the hacker and bought the key collection to preserve its history and did so successfully. The key eventually appeared on Optional PvP worlds in the hands of other collectors.\nThis key was added into the game by one of the map creators (before CipSoft became a big company they used volunteers to do areas). This person added the key into the game in secret. When CipSoft found out that there was a hidden key, they removed its function.\nThe old master key was wooden (brown) and the new one is magical (purple).\n\nKarr's old house with Shapeshifter's keyPast Test serverOld master keyWooden Key 0000 on Pacera in 2023",

Go down to a room with three Cyclops and down again to a small cave with some Rats. The corpse is located in the south-east corner under some rubbish. This key opens the door to a room, over the Minotaur Outcasts' camp, where Cyclops guard Key 3610 and some other treasures. There's a Lever that allows access to the same room by moving part of the wall but it also closes the way back and can only be used once every Floor Reset.\nKey 3610 is needed for the Devil Helmet Quest which is a level 30 quest but you need to get past level 40 Gate of Expertise to get key 3667.",
